# GEMINI.md

## Project Overview

This project is dedicated to creating a digital legacy for the user's children. It is envisioned as a "digital garden" comprising interlinked Markdown (`.md`) files, designed for non-linear reading. The primary writing and editing will be performed using Obsidian.

This top-level directory serves as the control center for leveraging AI tools, such as Gemini, to manage various aspects of the project, including content review, editing, and deployment.

## Directory Structure

The project contains an Obsidian vault named "Roots and Branches" which is a subdirectory of this top-level directory. This vault will house all the Markdown files for the digital garden.

- `Roots and Branches/`: The main Obsidian vault.
  - `.obsidian/`: Contains Obsidian's configuration files for the vault.

## Key Files

- Markdown files (`.md`): These files, located within the "Roots and Branches" vault, will contain the core content of the digital garden and will be interlinked to form the digital legacy.
- `GEMINI.md`: This file provides instructional context for AI interactions with the project.

## Usage

- **Obsidian:** Used for authoring, editing, and managing the interlinked Markdown notes within the "Roots and Branches" vault.
- **AI Tools (e.g., Gemini):** Utilized from this top-level directory for tasks such as:
  - Reviewing and providing feedback on the Markdown content.
  - Assisting with editing and refining the text.
  - Managing deployment processes for the digital garden.
